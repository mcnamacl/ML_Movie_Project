# ML_Movie_Project

A machine learning project using movie data to predict box office revenue completed as part of a university module. 

We have chosen to tackle the problem of “Can you predict how much revenue a film is going to generate in the box office?”. We think this is an interesting topic to investigate as there are so many different factors that affect how successful a movie is. For example, often a movie that is expected to do well ends up flopping in the box office, and vice versa. We want to see if it is possible to predict, to a certain degree, how successful a movie will be, based on a set of factors.
